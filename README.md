# Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built a fun and interative web-based application that allows the user to play two types of Rock, Paper, Scissors: a classic game with the traditional three player selections, or a Harry Potter-based wizard duel variation with five wizard fighters to choose from. The user can play an unlimited number of rounds against the computer. At the end of each round, a winner (or draw) is announced and the game is automatically reset for a new round. Individual counters keep track of the user and computer scores. At any time, the user can click a "Reset Wins?" button to set the win count back to zero, or a "Choose Game?" button to play a different version of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
